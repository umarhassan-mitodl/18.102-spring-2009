Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Analysis I (18.100); Linear Algebra (18.06), Linear Algebra (18.700), or Algebra I (18.701)

Topics
------

The course will be in three approximately equal parts (so about 4 weeks each).

1.  Normed spaces and a brief treatment of integration
    *   Norms, bounded linear operators, completeness
    *   Step functions, covering lemma, Lebesgue integrable functions
    *   Fatou's lemma, dominated convergence, L1
2.  Hilbert space
    *   Cauchy's inequality, Bessel's inequality, orthonormal bases
    *   Convex sets, minimization, Riesz' theorem, adjoints
    *   Compact sets, weak convergence, Baire's theorem, uniform boundeness
3.  Operators on Hilbert space
    *   Finite rank and compact operators
    *   Spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators
    *   Fourier series, periodic functions
    *   Dirichlet problem on the interval, completeness of eigenfunctions

Grading
-------

Grades will be computed by two methods â€” the cumulative and the hope-springs-eternal method with the actual grade the greater of the two.

*   First method: Homework 30, Tests 30, Final 40
*   Second method is based purely on the final
